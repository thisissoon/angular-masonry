# Angular Masonry

[![Commitizen friendly][commitizen-badge]][commitizen]

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Making Commits

This repo uses [Commitizen CLI][commitizen] and [Conventional Changelog][conventional-changelog] to create commits and generate changelogs. Instead of running `git commit` run `git cz` and follow the prompts. Changelogs will then be generated when creating new releases by running `npm run release`.

## Making Releases

Run `npm run release` to create a new release. This will use [Standard Version][standard-version] to create a new release. [Standard Version][standard-version] will generate / update the changelog based on commits generated using [Commitizen CLI][commitizen], update the version number following semantic versioning rules and then commit and tag the commit for the release. Simply run `git push --follow-tags origin master`.
